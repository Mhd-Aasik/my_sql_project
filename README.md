Brief introduction about group project 

The current manual system of processing university information at the Faculty of Technology, University of Ruhuna, is not efficient and accurate.
To address this, the plan is to adopt a Database Management System (DBMS) particularly for the process of managing students. The new system will make data processing automatic,
reduce the need for manual input that may introduce errors, and enhance the efficiency level of processing information of students,
starting from registration, up to academic records, and others. Using this DBMS, the Faculty can look forward to effective functioning, 
easier data access, and better reporting, all contributing to a well-organized and reliable student management process.
